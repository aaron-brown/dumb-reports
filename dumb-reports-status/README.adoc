= Dumb Reports (Status)

This implementation of `dumb-reports` implements a *`Report`* that provides
the concept of a `status` (both at the *Report* level and at the `entries`
level).

*StatusReport* is intended to be extensible, allowing you to create and add
your own statuses (possibly via an *Enum*).
